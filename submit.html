            <h2>A new view</h2>
            <p>In the Rietveld building, you step directly into Van Gogh’s world. You obviously see his masterpieces,
                but also
                his drawings and letters. You discover the ideas and ambitions behind his art.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh experienced life and the world intensely and wanted his art to portray the great themes of life,
                such as
                anxiety, suffering, love and hope. You follow the on-going search of an artist who was constantly trying
                to
                improve himself. In this way, you get a new view of an artist you thought you knew.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Paintings, drawings and letters</h2>
            <p>The story of his art is told throughout the galleries, not only giving a permanent position to his
                paintings but
                also to his drawings and letters. Important aspects of Van Gogh’s art are highlighted and studied
                through
                varying themes.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh’s ambition to paint farmers, his search for colour and his personal interpretation of nature are
                given a
                prominent place in the museum, naturally featuring highlights like The Potato Eaters, The Bedroom,
                Sunflowers
                and Almond Blossom.</p>

            <h2>Inspiring the world</h2>
            <p>The huge impact of Van Gogh on the first generation of artists after his death will be shown by
                expressive works
                such as those by Maurice de Vlaminck and Kees van Dongen from the museum's own collection.</p>
            <p>A video installation in the hall shows how, after his death, Van Gogh has become the important
                (pop)cultural icon
                that he is today.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh's hope that his work might go on inspiring the world after his death has come true: until this
                very day
                he reaches out to millions of admirers.</p>
